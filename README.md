The problem indicates a data analysis structure in which data from the given files are being read and interpreted.
I used Node JS file system to read the content of each file to further obtain data from the file. I read the data and analyzed them through object sorting and filtering in which I was able to gather the required statistics.
In general, I read the data from each file, I analyzed, sorted it and logged out the results.
